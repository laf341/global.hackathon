I like Gameboy Advance games and putting strange Unicode characters in places they shouldn't be and HTML and CSS and Javascript and Infocom text adventures and SuperTuxKart and TeX and C and Lego Mindstorms and U+202E RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE and assembly language and GLSL shaders and Blender and installing Linux on things and writing Python scripts to convert things into other things and SQL and the Source engine and making apps for iOS and wiping my hard drive before updating OS X to a new major version and `M-x tetris` and NetHack and Portal and writing long lists of things I like.
